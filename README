Project Organisation
====================

Documentation files (both in text and HTML format):

- [`README`](README.html): Project organisation
- [`src/README`](src/README.html): Source organisation

Main directories:

- `src`:        Project source
- `tests`:      Source directory for AUnits tests
- `obj`:        Built objects directory
- `bin`:        Built executables directory
- `features`:   The feature files to test xspec
- `doc`:        Contains the documentation

The file `Markdown.pl` is used to generate HTML pages from the text files using
the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax

Project files
-------------

- `config.gpr`: GNAT abstract project containing a centralized configuration
- `main.gpr`:   GNAT project to build xspec
- `tests.gpr`:  GNAT projects for AUnit tests
- `Makefile`:   Standard Makefile


`features` directory
--------------------

The `features` directory contains many different `.feature` files that describe
features of wspec using the [cucumber](http://cukes.info/) syntax. It also
contains:

- `cucumber`: This contains the cucumber features that do not apply to xspec
  yet. They should be modified to fit xspec in the future.

- `step_definitions`: The step definitions written in Ada that translate the
  sentances in the feature files in code that can be executed

- `tests`: Contains the tests generated by xspec from the feature files. The
  tests generated have the same name as the feature file but with a `.ads` or
  `.adb` suffix.
