--  To compile features files, just run:
--      redo features/xreq
--  or run:
--      ./do features/xreq
--
--  To generate the missing step definitions:
--      xreq --fill-steps-in generated_steps features/*.feature
--
--  This will create the files:
--      features/tests/*.ad[bs]
--
--  Then you can recompile this project
