Source Organisation
===================

Entry point: `Main` (`main.ads`, `main.adb`)

`Util` package
--------------

Contain utilitarian functions and procedures that are not specific to AdaSpec.

- `Util.IO`: tools to read lines and files in `Unbounded_String`s
- `Util.Strings`: tools to manipulate strings
- `Util.Strings.Pool`: make sure you get a unique string

`AdaSpec` package
-----------------

- `AdaSpec.CLI`: Help for command line interface
- `AdaSpec.Features`: Feature file parser and abstract syntax tree
- `AdaSpec.Stanzas`: Stanza type, represents a Given, When, Then line in a
  scenario
- `AdaSpec.Steps`: Step definition interface
- `AdaSpec.Steps.Ada`: Step definition and datatypes for the Ada language
- `AdaSpec.Job`: Represents a job, something to do. Generally extracted from
  the command line
- `AdaSpec.Result`: The result of a job, when it is executed. It contains all
  the data to output the test file.


Data flow
=========

First, the command line create a job (`AdaSpec.Job.Job_Type`) containing the
filename of the feature to execute. To run the job, it must be associated with
and environment (`AdaSpec.Job.Job_Environment`) that contains the output
directory for the tests and the `step_definitions` directory.

The environment is loaded (`AdaSpec.Job.Load`). This step read the
`step_definitions` directory and all the steps in it. The steps
(`AdaSpec.Steps.Steps_Type`) are stored in the environment.

Then, the job is run (`AdaSpec.Job.Run`) and the feature file is parsed
(`AdaSpec.Features.Feature_Type`) and stored in the job. Then, we match each
stanza of each scenario of the feature to steps taken from the environment.

The result (`AdaSpec.Result.Result_Feature_Type`) is the list of scenarios
procedures and all the steps they need to call to run the scenario. Then, the
generator generates Ada code.
