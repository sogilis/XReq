Feature: xreq commandline
  In order to execute xreq
  As an xreq user
  I want to have a command line interface

  Background:
    Given xreq is in the PATH
    And   I am in the xreq directory

  @lang @lang-C
  Scenario: Step matching only (--partial --step-matching)
    When I run xreq -x suite -lC --partial --step-matching features/data/simplest.feature
    Then it should pass with
    """
