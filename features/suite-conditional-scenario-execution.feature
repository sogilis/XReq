Feature: Run conditionally scenarios
  In order to only run the scenarios I am interested in
  As a test suite runner
  I want to be able to specify on the command line the list of scenarios to
  execute in the form FILENAME:NUM


  Background:
    Given xreq is in the PATH
    And I am in the xreq directory

  Scenario: Conditional run
    Given a file "features/data/tmp-a.feature":
      """
      Feature: A
        Description of A
        in two lines

        even three

          Given this step works

        Scenario: S1
          Given this step works

        Scenario: S2
          Given this step works

        Scenario: S3
          Given this step works
