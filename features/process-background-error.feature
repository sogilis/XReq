Feature: Skip scenarios after a background error
  In order to avoid executing steps that are sure to fail
  As an xreq user
  I want to avoid executing steps when the background was not successfull.

  If the first background is unsuccessfull, then the feature should stop
  alltogether. But if a background fail just before a scenario that is not the
  first, just skip this scenario.

  Background: Set things up
    Given xreq is in the PATH
    And I am in the xreq directory
    And a file "features/data/tmp-always_fail.feature":
      """
