Feature: List all scenarios compiled in a test suite
  In order to run scenarios conditionally based on their feature file name and
  scenario sequence number
  As an test suite runner
  I want to see the list of compiled scenarios in a test suite in the form of

  FEATURE_FILENAME:SCENARIO_NUM

  Background:
    Given xreq is in the PATH
    And I am in the xreq directory

  Scenario: Command line --list
    Given a file "features/data/tmp-a.feature":
      """
      Feature: A
        Description of A
        in two lines

        even three
