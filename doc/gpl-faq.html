    itself has been distributed under the same terms. If a user decides
    to take the project's code (incorporating my contributions) under

    patent license to that user?</a></li>

    <li><a href="#v3ConditionalWarranty">If I distribute a GPLv3-covered

<dt><b><a name="WhyDoesTheGPLPermitUsersToPublishTheirModifiedVersions">
Why does the GPL permit users to publish their modified versions?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
<p>A crucial aspect of free software is that users are free to cooperate.
It is absolutely essential to permit users who wish to help each other
to share their bug fixes and improvements with other users.</p>

<p>Some have proposed alternatives to the GPL that require modified
versions to go through the original author.  As long as the original
author keeps up with the need for maintenance, this may work well in
practice, but if the author stops (more or less) to do something else
or does not attend to all the users' needs, this scheme falls down.
Aside from the practical problems, this scheme does not allow users to
help each other.</p>

<p>Sometimes control over modified versions is proposed as a means of
preventing confusion between various versions made by users.  In our
experience, this confusion is not a major problem.  Many versions of
Emacs have been made outside the GNU Project, but users can tell them
apart.  The GPL requires the maker of a version to place his or her
name on it, to distinguish it from other versions and to protect the
reputations of other maintainers.
</p></dd>

<dt><b><a name="GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic">Does the GPL require that
source code of modified versions be posted to the public?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
<p>The GPL does not require you to release your modified version, or any
part of it.  You are free to make modifications and use them privately,
without ever releasing them.  This applies to organizations (including
companies), too; an organization can make a modified version and use it
internally without ever releasing it outside the organization.</p>

<p>But <em>if</em> you release the modified version to the public in some
way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the
program's users, under the GPL.</p>

<p>Thus, the GPL gives permission to release the modified program in
certain ways, and not in other ways; but the decision of whether to release
it is up to you.

<dd>
<p>If you choose to provide source through a written offer, then anybody
who requests the source from you is entitled to receive it.</p>
<p>
If you commercially distribute binaries not accompanied with source
code, the GPL says you must provide a written offer to distribute the
source code later.  When users non-commercially redistribute the
binaries they received from you, they must pass along a copy of this
written offer.  This means that people who did not get the binaries
directly from you can still receive copies of the source code, along with
the written offer.</p>
<p>
The reason we require the offer to be valid for any third party
is so that people who receive the binaries indirectly in that way
can order the source code from you.

You are not required to claim a copyright on your changes.  In most

If people have to pay when they get a copy of a program, or if they
have to notify anyone in particular, then the program is not free.
See the <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">

<p>It might be tempting to include a URL that refers to the license,

<p>For some licenses, the way in which the combination is made may affect
whether they are compatible&mdash;for instance, they may allow linking two
modules together, but not allow merging their code into one module.</p>

<dt><b><a name="FSWithNFLibs">Can I write
free software that uses non-free libraries?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
If you do this, your program won't be fully usable in a free
environment. If your program depends on a non-free library to do a
certain job, it cannot do that job in the Free World. If it depends on a
non-free library to run at all, it cannot be part of a free operating
system such as GNU; it is entirely off limits to the Free World.
<p>
So please consider: can you find a way to get the job done without using
this library? Can you write a free replacement for that library?</p>
<p>
If the program is already written using the non-free library, perhaps it
is too late to change the decision. You may as well release the program
as it stands, rather than not release it. But please mention in the
README that the need for the non-free library is a drawback, and suggest
the task of changing the program so that it does the same job without
the non-free library.  Please suggest that anyone who thinks of doing
substantial further work on the program first free it from dependence
on the non-free library.</p>
<p>
Note that there may also be legal issues with combining certain non-free
libraries with GPL-covered Free Software.  Please see <a
href="#GPLIncompatibleLibs">the question on GPL software with
GPL-incompatible libraries</a> for more information.
</p></dd>


<dt><b><a name="GPLIncompatibleLibs">What
legal issues come up if I use GPL-incompatible libraries with GPL
software?</a></b></dt>

<dd>

<p>Both versions of the GPL have an exception to their copyleft, commonly
  called the system library exception.  If the GPL-incompatible libraries
  you want to use meet the criteria for a system library, then you don't
  have to do anything special to use them; the requirement to distribute
  source code for the whole program does not include those libraries, even
  if you distribute a linked executable containing them.</p>

<p>The criteria for what counts as a &quot;system library&quot; vary
  between different versions of the GPL.  GPLv3 explicitly defines
  &quot;System Libraries&quot; in section 1, to exclude it from the
  definition of &quot;Corresponding Source.&quot; GPLv2 says the following,
  near the end of section 3:</p>

<blockquote><p>
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
     include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
     binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.
</p></blockquote>

<p>If you want your program to link against a library not covered by the
  system library exception, you need to provide permission to do that.
  Below are two example license notices that you can use to do that; one
  for GPLv3, and the other for GPLv2.  In either case, you should put this
  text in each file to which you are granting this permission.</p>

<p>Only the copyright holders for the program can legally release their
  software under these terms. If you wrote the whole program yourself, then
  assuming your employer or school does not claim the copyright, you are
  the copyright holder&mdash;so you can authorize the exception. But if you want
  to use parts of other GPL-covered programs by other authors in your code,
  you cannot authorize the exception for them. You have to get the approval
  of the copyright holders of those programs.</p>

<p>When other people modify the program, they do not have to make the same
  exception for their code&mdash;it is their choice whether to do so.</p>

<p>If the libraries you intend to link with are non-free, please also see
  <a href="#FSWithNFLibs">the section on writing Free Software which uses
  non-free libraries</a>.</p>

<p>If you're using GPLv3, you can accomplish this goal by granting an
  additional permission under section 7.  The following license notice will
  do that.  You must replace all the text in brackets with text that is
  appropriate for your program.  If not everybody can distribute source for
  the libraries you intend to link with, you should remove the text in
  braces; otherwise, just remove the braces themselves.</p>

<dt><b><a name="HowIGetCopyright">How do I
  get a copyright on my program in order to release it under the
  GPL?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Under the Berne Convention, everything written is automatically
copyrighted from whenever it is put in fixed form.  So you don't have to do
anything to &ldquo;get&rdquo; the copyright on what you write&mdash;as long
as nobody else can claim to own your work.</p>

<p>However, registering the copyright in the US is a very good idea.  It
will give you more clout in dealing with an infringer in the US.</p>

<p>The case when someone else might possibly claim the copyright is if
you are an employee or student; then the employer or the school might
claim you did the job for them and that the copyright belongs to them.
Whether they would have a valid claim would depend on circumstances
such as the laws of the place where you live, and on your employment
contract and what sort of work you do.  It is best to consult a lawyer
if there is any possible doubt.</p>

<p>If you think that the employer or school might have a claim, you can
resolve the problem clearly by getting a copyright disclaimer signed
by a suitably authorized officer of the company or school.  (Your
immediate boss or a professor is usually NOT authorized to sign such a
disclaimer.)
</p></dd>

<dt><b><a name="WhatIfSchool">What if my school
  might want to make my program into its own proprietary software
  product?</a></b></dt>

<dd><p>Many universities nowadays try to raise funds by restricting the use
of the knowledge and information they develop, in effect behaving little
different from commercial businesses.  (See &ldquo;The Kept
University&rdquo;, Atlantic Monthly, March 2000, for a general discussion
of this problem and its effects.)</p>

<p>If you see any chance that your school might refuse to allow your
program to be released as free software, it is best to raise the issue
at the earliest possible stage.  The closer the program is to working
usefully, the more temptation the administration might feel to take it
from you and finish it without you.  At an earlier stage, you have
more leverage.</p>

<p>So we recommend that you approach them when the program is only
half-done, saying, &ldquo;If you will agree to releasing this as free
software, I will finish it.&rdquo;  Don't think of this as a bluff.  To
prevail, you must have the courage to say, &ldquo;My program will have
liberty, or never be born.&rdquo;

<dd><p>Yes, because the copyright on the editors and tools does not cover
the code you write.  Using them does not place any restrictions, legally,
on the license you use for your code.</p>

<p>Some programs copy parts of themselves into the output for technical
reasons&mdash;for example, Bison copies a standard parser program into its
output file.  In such cases, the copied text in the output is covered
by the same license that covers it in the source code.  Meanwhile, the
part of the output which is derived from the program's input inherits
the copyright status of the input.</p>

<p>As it happens, Bison can also be used to develop non-free programs.
This is because we decided to explicitly permit the use of the Bison
standard parser program in Bison output files without restriction.  We
made the decision because there were other tools comparable to Bison
which already permitted use for non-free programs.

<p>However, when a US federal government agency uses contractors to
develop software, that is a different situation.  The contract can

  I can GPL the output people get from use of my program?  For example,
  if my program is used to develop hardware designs, can I require that

<dd><p>In general this is legally impossible; copyright law does not give you
any say in the use of the output people make from their data using
your program.  If the user uses your program to enter or convert his
own data, the copyright on the output belongs to him, not you.  More
generally, when a program translates its input into some other form,
the copyright status of the output inherits that of the input it was
generated from.</p>

<p>So the only way you have a say in the use of the output is if
substantial parts of the output are copied (more or less) from text in
your program.  For instance, part of the output of Bison (see above)
would be covered by the GNU GPL, if we had not made an exception in
this specific case.</p>

<p>You could artificially make a program copy certain text into its
output even if there is no technical reason to do so.  But if that
copied text serves no practical purpose, the user could simply delete
that text from the output and use only the rest.  Then he would not
have to obey the conditions on redistribution of the copied text.

<dt><b><a name="IfLibraryIsGPL">If a library
  is released under the GPL (not the LGPL), does that mean that any

library.</p></dd>

<dt><b><a name="IfInterpreterIsGPL">If a
  programming language interpreter is released under the GPL, does that
  mean programs written to be interpreted by it must be under
  GPL-compatible licenses?</a></b></dt>

<dd><p>
When the interpreter just interprets a language, the answer is no.  The
interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; a free software
license like the GPL, based on copyright law, cannot limit what data you
use the interpreter on.  You can run it on any data (interpreted program),
any way you like, and there are no requirements about licensing that data
to anyone.</p>

<p>However, when the interpreter is extended to provide
&ldquo;bindings&rdquo; to other facilities (often, but not necessarily,
libraries), the interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities
it uses through these bindings. So if these facilities are released under
the GPL, the interpreted program that uses them must be released in a
GPL-compatible way.  The JNI or Java Native Interface is an example of such
a binding mechanism; libraries that are accessed in this way are linked
dynamically with the Java programs that call them.  These libraries are
also linked with the interpreter.  If the interpreter is linked statically
with these libraries, or if it is designed to
<a href="#GPLPluginsInNF">link dynamically with these specific
libraries</a>, then it too needs to be released in a GPL-compatible
way.</p>
<p>
Another similar and very common case is to provide libraries with the
interpreter which are themselves interpreted.  For instance, Perl
comes with many Perl modules, and a Java implementation comes with
many Java classes.  These libraries and the programs that call them
are always dynamically linked together.</p>
<p>
A consequence is that if you choose to use GPL'd Perl modules or Java
classes in your program, you must release the program in a
GPL-compatible way, regardless of the license used in the Perl or Java
interpreter that the combined Perl or Java program will run on.

<p>The GPL permits this because that run-time library normally accompanies

Because it imposes a specific requirement that is not in the GPL; namely,

states:</p>

<blockquote><p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the

<p>GPLv3 says something similar in section 10.  The advertising clause

<dd>
<p>An &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; consists of a number of separate programs,
distributed together on the same CD-ROM or other media.  The GPL permits
you to create and distribute an aggregate, even when the licenses of the
other software are non-free or GPL-incompatible.  The only condition is
that you cannot release the aggregate under a license that prohibits users
from exercising rights that each program's individual license would
grant them.</p>

<p>Where's the line between two separate programs, and one program with two
parts?  This is a legal question, which ultimately judges will decide.  We
believe that a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of
communication (exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address
space, etc.)  and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of
information are interchanged).</p>

<p>If the modules are included in the same executable file, they are
definitely combined in one program.  If modules are designed to run
linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means
combining them into one program.</p>

<p>By contrast, pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are
communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs.
So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are
separate programs.  But if the semantics of the communication are
intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too
could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger
program.

<dd>
Our lawyers have told us that to be in the <a href="/licenses/why-assign.html">best position to enforce

We also ask individual contributors to get copyright disclaimers from

Of course, if all the contributors put their code in the public

A system incorporating a GPL-covered program is an extended version of
that program.  The GPL says that any extended version of the program
must be released under the GPL if it is released at all.  This is for
two reasons: to make sure that users who get the software get the
freedom they should have, and to encourage people to give back
improvements that they make.</p>
<p>
However, in many cases you can distribute the GPL-covered software
alongside your proprietary system.  To do this validly, you must make
sure that the free and non-free programs communicate at arms length,
that they are not combined in a way that would make them
effectively a single program.</p>
<p>
The difference between this and &ldquo;incorporating&rdquo; the GPL-covered
software is partly a matter of substance and partly form.  The substantive
part is this: if the two programs are combined so that they become
effectively two parts of one program, then you can't treat them as two
separate programs.  So the GPL has to cover the whole thing.</p>
<p>
If the two programs remain well separated, like the compiler and the
kernel, or like an editor and a shell, then you can treat them as two
separate programs&mdash;but you have to do it properly.  The issue is
simply one of form: how you describe what you are doing.  Why do we
care about this?  Because we want to make sure the users clearly
understand the free status of the GPL-covered software in the
collection.</p>
<p>
If people were to distribute GPL-covered software calling it &ldquo;part
of&rdquo; a system that users know is partly proprietary, users might be
uncertain of their rights regarding the GPL-covered software.  But if they
know that what they have received is a free program plus another program,
side by side, their rights will be clear.

<dd>
There are two reasons for this.
<p>
First, a general one.  If we permitted company A to make a proprietary

drive a truck through.  This would be carte blanche for withholding

that Q any part of it can be used under the GPL.  Putting it in other

If the license of module Q permits you to give permission for that,
then it is GPL-compatible.  Otherwise, it is not GPL-compatible.</p>

If the license for Q says in no uncertain terms that you must do certain

Using the Lesser GPL for any particular library constitutes a retreat
for free software.  It means we partially abandon the attempt to
defend the users' freedom, and some of the requirements to share what
is built on top of GPL-covered software.  In themselves, those are
changes for the worse.
<p>
Sometimes a localized retreat is a good strategy.  Sometimes, using
the LGPL for a library might lead to wider use of that library, and
thus to more improvement for it, wider support for free software, and
so on.  This could be good for free software if it happens to a large
extent.  But how much will this happen?  We can only speculate.</p>
<p>
It would be nice to try out the LGPL on each library for a while, see
whether it helps, and change back to the GPL if the LGPL didn't help.
But this is not feasible.  Once we use the LGPL for a particular
library, changing back would be difficult.</p>

Maximizing the number of users is not our aim.  Rather, we are trying

<dt><b><a name="VersionThreeOrLater">Why should programs say &ldquo;Version
3 of the GPL or any later version&rdquo;?</a></b></dt>

<dd><p>From time to time, at intervals of years, we change the
GPL&mdash;sometimes to clarify it, sometimes to permit certain kinds of use
not previously permitted, and sometimes to tighten up a requirement.  (The
last two changes were in 2007 and 1991.)  Using this &ldquo;indirect
pointer&rdquo; in each program makes it possible for us to change the
distribution terms on the entire collection of GNU software, when we update
the GPL.</p>

<p>If each program lacked the indirect pointer, we would be forced to
discuss the change at length with numerous copyright holders, which would
be a virtual impossibility.  In practice, the chance of having uniform
distribution terms for GNU software would be nil.</p>

<p>Suppose a program says &ldquo;Version 3 of the GPL or any later
version&rdquo; and a new version of the GPL is released.  If the new GPL
version gives additional permission, that permission will be available
immediately to all the users of the program.  But if the new GPL version
has a tighter requirement, it will not restrict use of the current version
of the program, because it can still be used under GPL version 3.  When a
program says &ldquo;Version 3 of the GPL or any later version&rdquo;, users
will always be permitted to use it, and even change it, according to the
terms of GPL version 3&mdash;even after later versions of the GPL are
available.</p>

<p>If a tighter requirement in a new version of the GPL need not be obeyed
for existing software, how is it useful?  Once GPL version 4 is available,
the developers of most GPL-covered programs will release subsequent
versions of their programs specifying &ldquo;Version 4 of the GPL or any
later version&rdquo;.  Then users will have to follow the tighter
requirements in GPL version 4, for subsequent versions of the program.</p>

<p>However, developers are not obligated to do this; developers can
continue allowing use of the previous version of the GPL, if that is their
preference.

<dt><b><a name="WhyNotGPLForManuals">Why
don't you use the GPL for manuals?</a></b></dt>

<dd><p>It is possible to use the GPL for a manual, but the GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL) is much better for manuals.</p>

<p>The GPL was designed for programs; it contains lots of complex clauses
that are crucial for programs, but that would be cumbersome and
unnecessary for a book or manual.  For instance, anyone publishing the
book on paper would have to either include machine-readable &ldquo;source
code&rdquo; of the book along with each printed copy, or provide a written
offer to send the &ldquo;source code&rdquo; later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the GFDL has clauses that help publishers of free manuals
make a profit from selling copies&mdash;cover texts, for instance.  The
special rules for Endorsements sections make it possible to use the
GFDL for an official standard.  This would permit modified versions,
but they could not be labeled as &ldquo;the standard&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Using the GFDL, we permit changes in the text of a manual that covers
its technical topic.  It is important to be able to change the
technical parts, because people who change a program ought to change
the documentation to correspond.  The freedom to do this is an
ethical imperative.</p>

<p>Our manuals also include sections that state our political position
about free software.  We mark these as &ldquo;invariant&rdquo;, so that
they cannot be changed or removed.  The GFDL makes provisions for these
&ldquo;invariant sections&rdquo;.

<p>It would be useful to have translations of the GPL into languages
other than English.  People have even written translations and sent
them to us.  But we have not dared to approve them as officially
valid.  That carries a risk so great we do not dare accept it.</p>

<p>A legal document is in some ways like a program.  Translating it is
like translating a program from one language and operating system to
another.  Only a lawyer skilled in both languages can do it&mdash;and even
then, there is a risk of introducing a bug.</p>

<p>If we were to approve, officially, a translation of the GPL, we would
be giving everyone permission to do whatever the translation says they
can do.  If it is a completely accurate translation, that is fine.
But if there is an error in the translation, the results could be a
disaster which we could not fix.</p>

<p>If a program has a bug, we can release a new version, and eventually
the old version will more or less disappear.  But once we have given
everyone permission to act according to a particular translation, we
have no way of taking back that permission if we find, later on, that
it had a bug.</p>

<p>Helpful people sometimes offer to do the work of translation for us.
If the problem were a matter of finding someone to do the work, this
would solve it.  But the actual problem is the risk of error, and
offering to do the work does not avoid the risk.  We could not
possibly authorize a translation written by a non-lawyer.</p>

<p>Therefore, for the time being, we are not approving translations
of the GPL as globally valid and binding.  Instead, we are doing two
things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Referring people to unofficial translations.
This means that we permit people to write translations of the GPL, but
we don't approve them as legally valid and binding.</p>

<p>An unapproved translation has no legal force, and it should say so
explicitly.  It should be marked as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
    This translation of the GPL is informal, and not officially approved
    by the Free Software Foundation as valid.  To be completely sure of
    what is permitted, refer to the original GPL (in English).
</p></blockquote>

<p>But the unapproved translation can serve as a hint for how to
understand the English GPL.  For many users, that is sufficient.</p>

<p>However, businesses using GNU software in commercial activity, and
people doing public ftp distribution, should need to check the real
English GPL to make sure of what it permits.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Publishing translations valid for a single country only.</p>

<p>We are considering the idea of publishing translations which are
officially valid only for one country.  This way, if there is a mistake, it
will be limited to that country, and the damage will not be too great.</p>

<p>It will still take considerable expertise and effort from a sympathetic
and capable lawyer to make a translation, so we cannot promise any
such translations soon.</p>

&ldquo;bindings&rdquo; to other facilities (often, but not necessarily,

<p>In general, the answer is no&mdash;this is not a legal requirement.  In
specific, the answer depends on which libraries you want to use and what
their licenses are.  Most system libraries either use the <a
href="/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser GPL</a>, or use the GNU GPL plus an
exception permitting linking the library with anything.  These libraries
can be used in non-free programs; but in the case of the Lesser GPL, it
does have some requirements you must follow.</p>

<p>Some libraries are released under the GNU GPL alone; you must use a
GPL-compatible license to use those libraries.  But these are normally
the more specialized libraries, and you would not have had anything much
like them on another platform, so you probably won't find yourself
wanting to use these libraries for simple porting.</p>

<p>Of course, your software is not a contribution to our community if it is
not free, and people who value their freedom will refuse to use it.
Only people willing to give up their freedom will use your software,
which means that it will effectively function as an inducement for people
to lose their freedom.</p>

<p>If you hope some day to look back on your career and feel that
it has contributed to the growth of a good and free society, you
need to make your software free.

I just found out that a company has a copy of a GPL'ed program, and it
costs money to get it.  Aren't they violating the GPL by not making it

<dd>
<p>No.  The GPL does not require anyone to use the Internet for
distribution.  It also does not require anyone in particular to
redistribute the program.  And (outside of one special case), even if
someone does decide to redistribute the program sometimes, the GPL
doesn't say he has to distribute a copy to you in particular, or any
other person in particular.</p>

<p>What the GPL requires is that he must have the freedom to distribute a
copy to you <em>if he wishes to</em>.  Once the copyright holder does
distribute a copy program to someone, that someone can then redistribute
the program to you, or to anyone else, as he sees fit.

I release a program with a license which says that you can distribute

<dd><p>No.  Such a license would be self-contradictory.  Let's look at its 
implications for me as a user.</p>

<p>Suppose I start with the original version (call it version A), add 
some code (let's imagine it is 1000 lines), and release that modified 
version (call it B) under the GPL.  The GPL says anyone can change 
version B again and release the result under the GPL.  So I (or 
someone else) can delete those 1000 lines, producing version C which 
has the same code as version A but is under the GPL.</p>

<p>If you try to block that path, by saying explicitly in the license that 
I'm not allowed to reproduce something identical to version A under 
the GPL by deleting those lines from version B, in effect the license 
now says that I can't fully use version B in all the ways that the GPL 
permits.  In other words, the license does not in fact allow a user to 
release a modified version such as B under the GPL.

Whether moving a copy to or from this subsidiary constitutes
&ldquo;distribution&rdquo; is a matter to be decided in each case under the
copyright law of the appropriate jurisdiction.  The GPL does not and cannot
override local laws.  US copyright law is not entirely clear on the point,
but appears not to consider this distribution.
</p><p>
If, in some country, this is considered distribution, and the
subsidiary must receive the right to redistribute the program,
that will not make a practical difference.  The subsidiary is
controlled by the parent company; rights or no rights, it won't
redistribute the program unless the parent company decides to do
so.

Some software packaging systems have a place which requires you to
click through or otherwise indicate assent to the terms of the GPL.
This is neither required nor forbidden.  With or without a click
through, the GPL's rules remain the same.</p>

<p>
Merely agreeing to the GPL doesn't place any obligations on you.  You

<dt><b><a name="v3HowToUpgrade">How do I upgrade from (L)GPLv2 to

<dd><p>First, include the new version of the license in your package.
    If you're using LGPLv3 in your project, be sure to include copies
    of both GPLv3 and LGPLv3, since LGPLv3 is now written as a set
    of additional permissions on top of GPLv3.</p>

<p>Second, replace all your existing v2 license notices (usually at
  the top of each file) with the new recommended text available on
  <a href="/licenses/gpl-howto.html">the GNU licenses howto</a>.  It's
  more future-proof because it no longer includes the FSF's postal

the package's license should also be updated appropriately.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><a name="BitTorrent">How does GPLv3 make
BitTorrent distribution easier?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Because GPLv2 was written before peer-to-peer distribution of
software was common, it is difficult to meet its requirements when you
share code this way.  The best way to make sure you are in compliance
when distributing GPLv2 object code on BitTorrent would be to include
all the corresponding source in the same torrent, which is
prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>GPLv3 addresses this problem in two ways.  First, people who
download this torrent and send the data to others as part of that
process are not required to do anything.  That's because section 9
says &ldquo;Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy
likewise does not require acceptance [of the license].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second, section 6(e) of GPLv3 is designed to give
distributors&mdash;people who initially seed torrents&mdash;a clear and
straightforward way to provide the source, by telling recipients where it
is available on a public network server.  This ensures that everyone who
wants to get the source can do so, and it's almost no hassle for the
distributor.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><a name="Tivoization">What is
tivoization? How does GPLv3 prevent it?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
<p>Some devices utilize free software that can be upgraded, but are
designed so that users are not allowed to modify that software.  There
are lots of different ways to do this; for example, sometimes the
hardware checksums the software that is installed, and shuts down if
it doesn't match an expected signature.  The manufacturers comply with
GPLv2 by giving you the source code, but you still don't have the
freedom to modify the software you're using.  We call this practice
tivoization.</p>
<p>When people distribute User Products that include software under
GPLv3, section 6 requires that they provide you with information
necessary to modify that software.  User Products is a term specially
defined in the license; examples of User Products include portable
music players, digital video recorders, and home security systems.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b><a name="DRMProhibited">Does GPLv3
prohibit DRM?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
<p>It does not; you can use code released under GPLv3 to develop any
kind of DRM technology you like.  However, if you do this, section 3
says that the system will not count as an effective technological
&ldquo;protection&rdquo; measure, which means that if someone breaks the DRM, he
will be free to distribute his software too, unhindered by the DMCA

it just stops them from restricting others.</p>

<dt><b><a name="GPLHardware">Can I use the GPL

<dd>
<p>Any material that can be copyrighted can be licensed under the GPL.
GPLv3 can also be used to license materials covered by other
copyright-like laws, such as semiconductor masks.  So, as an example,
you can release a drawing of a hardware design under the GPL.
However, if someone used that information to create physical hardware,
they would have no license obligations when distributing or selling
that device: it falls outside the scope of copyright and thus the GPL
itself.</p>

<dt><b><a name="GiveUpKeys">I use public key
cryptography to sign my code to assure its authenticity. Is it true
that GPLv3 forces me to release my private signing keys?</a></b></dt>

<dd>
<p>No.  The only time you would be required to release signing keys is
if you conveyed GPLed software inside a User Product, and its hardware
checked the software for a valid cryptographic signature before it
would function. In that specific case, you would be required to
provide anyone who owned the device, on demand, with the key to sign
and install modified software on his device so that it will run.  If
each instance of the device uses a different key, then you need only
give each purchaser the key for his instance.</p>

<dt><b><a name="v3VotingMachine">Does
GPLv3 require that voters be able to modify the software running in a

<p>No.  Companies distributing devices that include software under
GPLv3 are at most required to provide the source and Installation
Information for the software to people who possess a copy of the
object code.  The voter who uses a voting machine (like any other
kiosk) doesn't get possession of it, not even temporarily, so the
voter also does not get possession of the binary software in it.</p>
<p>Note, however, that voting is a very special case.  Just because
the software in a computer is free does not mean you can trust the

<dd>
<p>No.  When you convey GPLed software, you must follow the terms and

network.&rdquo; In most server-client architectures, it simply
wouldn't be reasonable to argue that the server operator is a
&ldquo;user&rdquo; interacting with the client in any meaningful
sense.</p>

<p>Consider HTTP as an example.  All HTTP clients expect servers to
provide certain functionality: they should send specified responses to
well-formed requests.  The reverse is not true: servers cannot assume
that the client will do anything in particular with the data they
send.  The client may be a web browser, an RSS reader, a spider, a
network monitoring tool, or some special-purpose program.  The server
can make absolutely no assumptions about what the client will
do&mdash;so there's no meaningful way for the server operator to be
considered a user of that software.</p></dd>

<dt><b><a name="AllCompatibility">How are the various GNU licenses
compatible with each other?</a></b></dt>   

<dd><p>The various GNU licenses enjoy broad compatibility between each
other.  The only time you may not be able to combine code under two of
these licenses is when you want to use code that's <em>only</em> under
an older version of a license with code that's under a newer
version.</p>

<p>Below is a detailed compatibility matrix for various combinations of the
GNU licenses, to provide an easy-to-use reference for specific cases.  It
assumes that someone else has written some software under one of these
licenses, and you want to somehow incorporate code from that into a project
that you're releasing (either your own original work, or a modified version
of someone else's GPLed software). Find the license for your own work in a
column at the top of the table, and the license for the other code in a row
on the left. The cell where they meet will tell you whether or not this
combination is permitted.</p>

<p>When we say &ldquo;copy code,&rdquo; we mean just that: you're taking a
section of code from one source, with or without modification, and
inserting it into your own program, thus forming a work based on the first
section of code.  &ldquo;Use a library&rdquo; means that you're not copying
any source directly, but instead interacting with it through linking,
importing, or other typical mechanisms that bind the sources together when
you compile or run the code.</p>
